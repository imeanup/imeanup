## ðŸ‘‹ Greetings â€” Iâ€™m Anupam ([@imeanup](https://imeanup.github.io/))

I build small, useful tools that make everyday web work less annoying. My current focus is **[Highlight Plus](https://imeanup.github.io/highlighter-support/)** â€” fast highlighter marks text in multiple colors across multiple tabs, with a quick toggle to turn highlighting on/off or reset it whenever needed. It started as a personal helper and turned into something I wanted to share because it actually made reading and researching faster.

### About me

I enjoy digging into problems across the stack â€” from tiny browser UX details to backend logic and performance. Iâ€™m pragmatic: I prefer clean, readable code and tools that solve one thing well.

Languages & tech I work with (real talk):

* Comfortable: **C / C++**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Python**
* Learning / tinkering: **Go**, **Ruby**
* Browser extensions, small web apps, and backend services

### What Iâ€™m looking for

Iâ€™m open to:

* Collaborations on backend projects or small tooling that improves developer workflow
* Opportunities to contribute to projects where practical, maintainable code matters
* Mentorship or pair work to level up in Go and backend architecture

If youâ€™ve got a small project or a specific problem, Iâ€™d rather try it out than talk about it â€” fork, open an issue, or send a short DM.
